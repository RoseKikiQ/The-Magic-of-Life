Magic

OverView:

The Magic of Life is a magic-based simulator about how your sight and hearing can trick you. Remember, what you see or hear isn’t always what’s real.

There're going to be 3 magic points, Sight, Sound, and the 5 elements of life 

How to Play:

Move around and interact with the scene.

Pay attention to how light and sound change your senses.

Try to understand what’s real, and what’s only illusion.

Futher improvement:

Idk, I'll have to search more up on what else can be tricked by us
